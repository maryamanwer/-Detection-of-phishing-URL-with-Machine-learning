# -Detection-of-phishing-URL-with-Machine-learning
Internet technologies have spread widely in recent years, not only in information-based websites but also in online social networking and online banking, making people's life simpler. As a result of this expansion, computer networks are exposed to a wide range of security risks from across the world. One of these major risks is "phishing," which seeks to fool its victims into getting their private information such as usernames, passwords, social security numbers, financial information, and credit card numbers through bogus e-mails, websites, or both. Detection of phishing attacks is difficult since it is a semantics-based assault that relies on user weaknesses rather than network flaws. In this research aimed to use a machine learning based algorithms to evaluate a unique collection of features which may be utilized to predict phishing URLs promptly and accurately using an ML method.
